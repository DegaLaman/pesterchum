Bugs
----
* No Sound #Due to removing pygame
* weird memo time bug

* Windows doesn't show style sheet sometimes?? Maybe related to themes.

* Issues with connecting? Client not closing connection right? People keep getting "nick taken" messages

* When using mood sort, scroll position jumps to last selected chum

* Closing a timeclone doesn't actually cease for everyone else

* Kill Zalgo

* Random invisible, tiny links to last link at end of every message

* Clicking link to invite-only memo crashes

* Close when banned from memo when main PC window minimized

* Chums not appearing on chumroll when initals are the same? (bS)

* Recognize IRC 471, 473, 474 and 475

* memo links aren't case sensitive

* Pesterdunk Ghostchum gives 'ERROR: boolean not subscriptable'


Windows Bugs
------------

* XP SP2: sometimes mouse clicks dont register? must be some kinda crash

* On reconnect and nick change, momentary theme change causes menu items to stop working

* Random chums won't show up on chumroll

* Popup toast notifications cause main window to raise


Mac Bugs

--------

* Mac doesn't show tabs right, display gifs, highlighting thing?

* SS: also the background image is broken
* SS: in the one-on-one pester it resizes with the window

* SS: but the memo one doesn't resize

* SS: and the arrows next to the time thing overlap the CLOSE button

* Lex: There seems to be a faint outline around most non-square themes.
